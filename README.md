These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). The solutions are written in plain [ES5 JavaScript](https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/), keeping away from the modern language features of ES6 and later. Type checking is disabled and the scripts are executed by a matching [Node.js 0.10.48](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v0.10.x/api/) runtime.
