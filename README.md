These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). The solutions are written in plain [ES5 JavaScript](https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/) and tested on a matching [Node.js 0.10.48](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v0.10.x/api/) runtime.

## Usage

```
node solve.js [--day=<day>] [--part=<part>] [--input=<file>]
```

Runs the indicated puzzle(s). If the `--input` option is omitted, the program will read `input.txt` from the puzzle folder. These default input files are not part of the repository.

```
node test.js [--day=<day>] [--part=<part>]
```

Runs the examples from the puzzle descriptions as test cases.
